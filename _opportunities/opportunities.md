# SIMSSA is hiring software developers for Summer 2022!

The Single Interface for Music Score Searching and Analysis (SIMSSA) project is hiring McGill undergraduate and graduate students to work as summer software developers.

Candidates should have a solid background in Python or JavaScript. Enrolment in a Computer Science, Software Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or Music Technology degree is preferred, but not required. Ability to read music notation is considered a strong asset.

The position goes from 2 May to 26 August 2022. The work week will be 35 hours, with ten days unpaid holiday to be taken at any point after the initial two-week training period. The hourly rate ranges from $16.48 to $27.59 depending on year at McGill (First-year Undergrad through late PhD), plus a percentage on top of hourly rate for vacation and statutory holiday indemnities. You will be classified as an AMURE casual research assistant, and this is taxable employment income.

To apply, please email the following documents to SIMSSA Research Associate Dr. Anna De Bakker ([anna.debakker@mcgill.ca](anna.debakker@mcgill.ca)) by midnight, AOE (anywhere on earth) **14 March 2022**:

* your CV
* your GitHub account (preferred) or a recent code example
* a cover letter
* your unofficial transcript (you can print a PDF from Minerva and include that)
